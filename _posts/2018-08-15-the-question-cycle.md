# A Thing I've Realized During My First Internship

Here's the thing:
## Don't be afraid of asking questions that seem "too broad".

When I started my internship in a firmware group at Medtronic, I wasted an undue amount of energy agonizing about how I didn't have enough knowledge to ask my coworkers hyper-specific questions right away. I knew a little bit of C, an even littler bit of x86 assembly, and next to nothing about cardiac physiology and pacing technology. I would start asking my coworker/mentor a question, and I'd quickly have the frustrating realization that I didn't know which terms to use for the concept I was attempting to ask about -- I quite literally did not know what I was talking about. After a few more instances of this I, defeated, went to my coworker and asked her to "tell me about XYZ".

I learned vastly more in the 15 minutes or so following that question than I had in N hours of stewing at my desk (where N equals an embarrassing number), and as a result, I finally had the building blocks from which I could construct the specific questions that would help me with the task at hand.

Of course, since getting answers to questions often leads to more questions, this became the cycle:

	1. Stew about how I don't know the right question to ask.
	2. Try to ask specific questions -- often unsuccessfully.
	3. Ask a broad question instead.
	4. Ask enough specific questions to propel me further with my work.
	5. Jump to step 1.

I'm calling this The Question Cycle, which is a name about as stupid sounding as Problem Sleuth, but which name I'm keeping because I can't come up with anything snazzier at this time, and also because I actually really love [the Problem Sleuth comic.](https://www.homestuck.com/problem-sleuth/1)

Note: Just because I said it's a cycle doesn't mean that it's a bad cycle. The time I spend stewing at the top node seems to strictly decrease with the number of times I traverse this cycle. I'm hopeful that this pattern will continue.
